## Context
This project involved creating a high-fidelity mockup for a complete redesign of a travel agency's website.

## Goals
The overarching goal was to completely reimagine the agency's online platform, moving from an outdated design to a modern, user-friendly experience that positions them as an industry innovator.

## Process
My design process was rooted in a user-centered approach, ensuring that the final concept was not only visually beautiful but also highly functional and aligned with both user needs and business goals.

## Outcome
The project concluded with the successful delivery of a complete design concept in Figma, which served as a tangible blueprint for the website's redevelopment. The client was thrilled with the outcome, particularly how the new design incorporated modern technology like the AI planner. Although the design files are confidential, the attached images effectively represent the final look and feel.
