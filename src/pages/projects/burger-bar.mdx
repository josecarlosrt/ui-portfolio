summary: "A conceptual website design created to serve as a visual inspiration for restaurant clients"
---

## Context
As a proactive initiative to inspire our restaurant clients, I was tasked with designing a series of conceptual websites showcasing modern design trends. This project features a bold, energetic mockup created to demonstrate how a daring visual style-using vibrant color blocks and expressive typography can create an unforgettable brand presence online
.
## Goals
Develop a Striking Visual Language: The main goal was to design a "bold site" by utilizing a layout with large color blocks and oversized, attention-grabbing typography. Implement a Daring Color Palette: Explore an unconventional yet appealing color scheme that would make a brand stand out in a competitive market.

## Process
The creative process began with a single point of inspiration: a billboard and its color scheme. From this starting point, I built out the entire design concept.

## Outcome
The design concept was highly successful as an internal sales and inspiration tool. Several clients positively reacted to the mockup, and a number of them requested to replicate specific sections and the bold aesthetic in their own website projects. Although this was a conceptual project and not developed into a live site, its enthusiastic reception validated the modern design direction and proved its value in demonstrating cutting-edge styles to clients.
