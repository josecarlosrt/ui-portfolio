## Context
El sitio tenía baja conversión y contenido desordenado. Audité navegación, jerarquía visual y performance.

## Goals
Given the tight deadline, I adopted an agile and iterative approach. The brand identity phase was fast-tracked, delivering initial logo concepts within the first week. Based on client feedback, we quickly refined the chosen direction, finalizing the logo and brand assets in under two weeks, which allowed us to move swiftly into the web design phase.
