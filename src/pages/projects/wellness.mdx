summary: "Collaborated with a client to enhance their live Shopify store with four specific custom-coded elements"
---

## Context
The owner of an active Shopify store approached me to develop and integrate several custom-coded features not available in their existing theme. The primary objective was to enhance the user experience by improving brand visibility and product discovery.

## Goals
The goal was to provide a more tailored shopping experience for their customers by adding new features to the theme's navigation, homepage, and product pages.

## Process
My process was structured to ensure safety, precision, and alignment with the client's vision, all while working on a live e-commerce platform

## Outcome
All four custom sections were successfully integrated into the live Shopify store, functioning exactly as the client envisioned. The entire project, from the initial brief to final delivery, was completed in less than two weeks, resulting in a highly satisfied client and a significantly enhanced shopping experience for their customers.
